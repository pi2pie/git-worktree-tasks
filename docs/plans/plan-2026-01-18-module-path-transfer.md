## Goal

Update the module path, import paths, and user-facing docs for the ownership transfer from `dev-pi2pie` to `pi2pie`, and bump the version to 0.0.7.

## Plan

1. Update module path/imports and documentation references to the new GitHub owner.
2. Bump the CLI version string to 0.0.7 and verify remaining references.
3. Summarize changes and note any follow-up release steps.
